## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

```{r}
x <- c(4, 7, 8, 11, 11, 12, 10, 14, 17, 18, 18, 20) 

matrix(1:16, nrow = 4)
dotchart(mtcars$mpg,labels=row.names(mtcars),cex=.7,
          main="Gas Milage for Car Models", 
          xlab="Miles Per Gallon")```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

dotchart(mtcars$mpg,labels=row.names(mtcars),cex=.7,
          main="Gas Milage for Car Models", 
          xlab="Miles Per Gallon")
